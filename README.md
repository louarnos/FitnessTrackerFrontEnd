# User Stories

- As a user I want to be able to search the database and see all entries containing keywords like â€œchicken"
- As a user I want to be able to see my last 5 meals
- As a user I want to be able to see my meals from a given date
- As a user I want to have an ideal macronutrient breakdown and see if my meal meets the ideal

# Next Step

- Make the foods table searchable by keyword
- Make meals searchable by name
- Create an ideal calories calculator based on users age, weight, gender, etc. with designated macronutrients breakdown
- Graph a meal/days meals as a macronutrient breakdown and compare to ideal.
- Total calories and macros for a given day.
